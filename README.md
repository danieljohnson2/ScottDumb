# ScottDumb
A driver for Scott Adams text adventures.

This project will start as a Python interpreter for Scott Adams adventures, but the goal is a graphical user interface that allows as much as possibly to be done by point and click. This will modernize the Adams' guess-the-word adventures into just-click-on-everything games that are completely free of pesky thinking!

This driver consumes the games in ScottFree's .DAT files.
