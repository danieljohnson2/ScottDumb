# ScottDumb
A driver for Scott Adams text adventures.

This project makes Scott Adams text adventures into point-and-click affairs, no
thinkig required!

OK, a little thinking may be needed. Not every command is available via the
mouse, yet.

This driver consumes the games in ScottFree's .DAT files.

The game window displays the room description at the top, your inventory on the
right, and you can enter commands at the bottom. But in the room description and
in the inventory, items may have underlines. Click on these items to get a menu
with available commands. Click to win!
